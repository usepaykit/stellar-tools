Preview this documentation site locally with the Mintlify CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the dev server">

From the directory that contains `docs.json` (e.g. `app/landing/docs`):

```bash
mint dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the docs. Changes to MDX files update automatically.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom port

Use a different port if 3000 is in use:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

## Validate links

Check for broken links:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

Docs are typically deployed via your host (e.g. Mintlify, or your own static deploy). Push changes to the branch connected to your docs to update the live site.
