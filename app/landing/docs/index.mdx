---

**Stellar Tools** lets you accept fast, low-cost crypto payments (Stellar/XLM and Stellar assets) with minimal setup. Use our REST API and adapters to add checkouts, subscriptions, and payouts to your app.

## What you can do

- **Checkouts** — Create one-time or subscription checkouts; get payment URLs or Stellar `web+stellar:tx` URIs for wallets.
- **Customers** — Create and manage customers; attach Stellar wallets for recurring payments.
- **Products** — Define one-time, subscription, or metered products (with price/asset or credits for usage-based billing).
- **Subscriptions** — Create and manage subscriptions on-chain (pause, resume, cancel).
- **Payments & refunds** — Retrieve payment status; issue refunds to a Stellar address.
- **Webhooks** — Receive events such as `payment.confirmed`, `subscription.canceled`, `refund.succeeded`.
- **Payouts** — Send assets from your organization wallet to any Stellar address (dashboard/session only).
