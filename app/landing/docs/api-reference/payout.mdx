Payouts send assets from your organization’s Stellar account to another address. **Requires session token** (dashboard user), not API key.

## Create payout

```http POST /api/payout
POST /api/payout
x-session-token: your_session_token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 100,
  "walletAddress": "G...",
  "assetId": "asset_xxx",
  "memo": "Optional memo text"
}
```

- `amount`: Amount to send (in the asset’s base unit, e.g. XLM count or USDC units).
- `walletAddress`: Destination Stellar public key.
- `assetId`: ID of the asset to send.

**Response** `200`: `{ "data": { "id", "status", "amount", "walletAddress", "transactionHash", "completedAt", ... } }`

Payout is processed asynchronously. Status is initially `pending`; when the transaction is submitted on-chain it becomes `succeeded` and `transactionHash` and `completedAt` are set.

<Warning>
  This endpoint uses your organization’s Stellar secret. Only use with a trusted session (dashboard). Do not expose session tokens to client-side or third parties.
