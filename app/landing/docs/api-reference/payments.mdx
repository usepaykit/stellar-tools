Payments are created when a checkout is paid. Use this API to fetch payment details and optionally refresh status from the chain.

## Get payment

```http GET /api/payment/:id
GET /api/payment/pay_xxx
x-api-key: your_api_key
```

Your server may refresh status from the Stellar network for `pending` payments depending on implementation.

**Response** `200`: `{ "data": { "id", "checkoutId", "status", "amount", "transactionHash", "customerId", "environment", ... } }`

Status can be `pending`, `completed`, or `failed`.
