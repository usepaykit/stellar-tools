Products define what you sell: a one-time payment, a subscription with a price and asset, or a **metered** product where customers pay by usage (credits).

## Create product

```http POST /api/product
POST /api/product
x-api-key: your_api_key
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Pro Plan",
  "description": "Monthly access",
  "type": "subscription",
  "assetId": "asset_xxx",
  "priceAmount": 10,
  "recurringPeriod": "monthly",
  "unit": "credits",
  "unitDivisor": 1,
  "unitsPerCredit": 1,
  "creditsGranted": 100,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

- `type`: `"one_time"`, `"subscription"`, or `"metered"`.
- `assetId`: ID of the asset (e.g. XLM, USDC) for pricing.
- `priceAmount`: Price in the asset’s smallest unit (e.g. stroops for XLM).
- `recurringPeriod`: For subscriptions: `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, or `"year"`.
- Optional: `unit`, `unitDivisor`, `unitsPerCredit`, `creditsGranted`, `creditExpiryDays`, `metadata`.

You can also send `multipart/form-data` with image files; the API accepts form data for product creation.

**Response** `200`: `{ "data": { "id", "name", "type", "priceAmount", "status", "assetId", "recurringPeriod", ... } }`

## Metered products

For `type: "metered"`, customers are charged by **usage** via credits. Set:

- **unit** — Name of the unit (e.g. `"tokens"`, `"MB"`, `"API calls"`).
- **unitDivisor** — Divide raw usage by this before converting to credits (e.g. `1` or `1_000_000` for bytes).
- **unitsPerCredit** — How many (post-divisor) units = 1 credit (e.g. `10` → 10 units = 1 credit).
- **creditsGranted** — Initial credits when the customer gets the product.
- **creditExpiryDays** — Optional; credits expire after this many days.

Credits are then managed with the [Credits API](/api-reference/credits): get balance, list transactions, and post deduct/refund/grant. See [Metered billing](/metered-billing) for the full flow and examples.
