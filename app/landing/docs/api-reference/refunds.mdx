Refunds send assets back to a receiver address (e.g. customer wallet) for a given payment.

## Create refund

```http POST /api/refunds
POST /api/refunds
x-api-key: your_api_key
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentId": "pay_xxx",
  "assetId": "asset_xxx",
  "amount": 10000000,
  "receiverPublicKey": "G...",
  "customerId": "cust_xxx",
  "reason": "Customer request",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

- `amount` is in stroops (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops). For other assets, use the asset’s smallest unit.
- `receiverPublicKey` is the Stellar account that receives the refund.

**Response** `200`: `{ "data": { refund object } }` or error with validation/state message.

<Note>
  Refunds trigger `refund.succeeded` or `refund.failed` webhook events.
